Better Maliwan Charge Time
==========================

Improves the charge time of all Maliwan weapons except for the following:

* Starkiller
* Ice Pick
* D.N.A.
* Atomizer pistols
* Melter pistols

Pistols and SMGs receive a 50% improvement, shotguns get 60%, and snipers will always
be instant-fire (though the models which fire on *releasing* the trigger will still do so).

TODO
====

- Would love to figure out those left-out guns
- It might make sense to also include a few non-Maliwan guns which have similar charging
  mechanics
