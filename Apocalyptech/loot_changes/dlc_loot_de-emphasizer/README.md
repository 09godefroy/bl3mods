DLC Loot De-Emphasizer
======================

So far, all Borderlands 3 DLCs (through DLC5, Designer's Cut) have had the
in-DLC enemies drop at increased rates from DLC-specific loot pools, so that
when you go through the DLC, you're very likely to acquire the gear that was
added with the DLC.  That's certainly nice the first time through, but I found
I wanted their drops in subsequent plays to just match all other world drops
from base game enemies.  That's what this mod does!

This mod is definitely intended to be used alongside my Expanded Legendary Pools mod,
which adds all DLC gear into the world drop pools.
