  active.

  (including the eventless Christmas menu)

## Deprecated/Broken Mods

I've also got a folder to contain mods which either didn't work, or which are
no longer needed (either because of changes to the game itself, or because it
was obsoleted by one of my other mods).  There's a README in there which details
most of those, so feel free to browse around if you want.

## Data Processing

There's also a `dataprocessing` dir here, which is various utils that I use to
pull data from BL3, mostly using the `bl3mods` and `bl3hotfixmod` modules up
in the main dir of this repo.  These are often in service of mod creation, though
there's also scripts which populate some Google Sheets that I maintain as well.
