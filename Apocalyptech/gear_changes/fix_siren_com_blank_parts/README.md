Fix Siren COM Blank Parts
=========================

Siren COMs have a peculiarity of their parts definition which means
that they can potentially spawn with one fewer part than they're
supposed to, or at least one fewer part than any other chars'
COMs have.  This is pretty rare, but it *is* something that's possible
in the data, so this mod just patches that up.

Changelog
=========

**v1.1.0** - Sep 26, 2020
 * Updated for DLC4 Siren COM

**v1.0.0** - Sep 26, 2020
 * First versioned release
