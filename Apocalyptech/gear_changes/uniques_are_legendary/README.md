Uniques Are Legendary
=====================

With just a few exceptions, turns nearly all red-text weapons/items into
legendary rarity, if they aren't already.  Mostly just intended to be used
along with my Expanded Legendary Pools mod, to make the dropped gear more
noticeable.  Without that mod, I think these mostly just come as mission
rewards or as mission items, so this mod would be a bit pointless.

I'm actually not sure if being legendary has an effect on item stats; it's
possible that this mod buffs up some items here.
