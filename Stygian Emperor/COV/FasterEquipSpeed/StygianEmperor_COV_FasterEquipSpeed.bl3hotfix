### DESCRIPTION
### Reduces the time it takes to "rev up" the crude engines of COV weapons to make them
### ready to fire in approximately the same time it takes to switch to normal Dahl guns. 
### However, the readying animations remain unchanged, so you will see your character's 
### hand move impossibly quickly over the weapons' starters immediately after drawing them.
### 
### This mod has not been tested with every single COV weapon, so there may be a legendary 
### or unique which still ready at their unmodded speed. Let me know if anything is amiss.
