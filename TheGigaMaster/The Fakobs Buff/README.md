The Fakobs Buff
================================

## Description

Buffs the everliving daylights out of the gun "The Shoddy" (AKA The Fakobs)
The gun is obtainable from the sidequest "Money Back Guarantee" in DLC 3
In essense, the gun is being designed to become a 1 shot destroyer.
However, it still requires that you be directly on top of your enemy.

The Redux_Compatible version is designed to be used with the Redux Mod by EpicNNG.

I plan on making more changes, but this is just a start.
