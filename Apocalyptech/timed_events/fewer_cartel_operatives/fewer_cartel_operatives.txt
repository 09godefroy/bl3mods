### I enjoy having Cartel operatives pop up all over the place and
### provide a bit more chaos, but at their stock spawn rates, nearly
### every enemy encounter ends up as a total scrum.  When I'm not
### actively hunting them down for a Cartels mission, I'd like to
### ease off a bit without getting rid of them entirely.  So this
### just cuts their spawn probability in half.
