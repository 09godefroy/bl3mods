Disable "Lootsplosion" Modifier
===============================

This simply disables the "Lootsplosion" Easy Mayhem Modifier, so it'll never show
up in your modifier rolls.  I've found that I just don't like that much loot
hanging all over the place.

Changelog
=========

**v1.0.0** - Sep 26, 2020
