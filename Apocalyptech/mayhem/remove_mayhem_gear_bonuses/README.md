Remove Mayhem Gear Bonuses
==========================

Removes the bonuses applied by Mayhem parts on your gear, so they
function just like gear without the Mayhem part applied.  The gear
*will* continue to display its Mayhem part on the item card, but
it won't have any effect so long as this mod is active.

This is mostly intended to be used along with mods which nerf the
Mayhem enemy scaling (such as my Decreased Mayhem Enemy Scaling or
Mayhem Level Cheats mods), so that mayhem gear doesn't become too
OP against mostly-unaugmented enemies.
