TheGigaMaster's BL3 Mods
=================================

Well, this certainly has grown a lot over the past few weeks. Wonder how much how I'll keep making!

I'm a sucker for folders because I like to keep thing's organized. 


# Guardian Angel Nerf

This mod nerf's the damage bonus provided by the Guardian Angel shotgun.

# Major Weapon Overhaul Mod

Rebalances nearly every unique/legendary weapon in the game.

# ReVolter Nerf

This mod nerf's the bonus damage provided by the shield break effect from the ReVolter shield.

# The Fakob's Buff

This was more of a meme mod, but it makes the Fakobs shotgun very powerful.

# Varkid Evolution Increase

Changes the chances of varkids evolving. The furthest normal varkids can evolve is SuperBadasses.
