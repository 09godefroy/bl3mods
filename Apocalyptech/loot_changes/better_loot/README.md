Better Loot
===========

Borderlands 3 honestly didn't really *need* a Better Loot mod, but here it
is anyway!  Like its BL2 and TPS counterparts, this mod does a number of
different things:

* Sets the rarity weights to be improved, globally
* Increases Eridium drop rates and quantities.
* Guarantees specific legendary drops from nearly all the bosses which
  have unique drops.  This has been updated through DLC4 (Psycho Krieg),
  and updated with the drop changes as recently as the 2020-08-20 patch.
* Unlocks Mayhem 4/Mayhem 6 drops for the named enemies as well.  Not sure if this
  unlocks world Mayhem 4 drops or not, but you can use my Expanded Legendary Pools
  mod for that.

Like the BL2+TPS versions of Better Loot, bosses which have more than one drop
assigned to them will drop from the pool that many times.  For instance, the Skrakk
is set to drop either Skeksil or an Infiltrator COM.  With Better Loot, it'll have
a guaranteed drop from that pool *twice* - you might get two Skeksils, two Infiltrators,
or one of each.  Some bosses with huge loot pools have been limited somewhat with
this.

Note that Mayhem levels increase drop quality as well, and a vanilla Mayhem 10
already drops extremely good gear.  I personally use my No Mayhem Drop Scaling mod
to remove those inbuilt buffs to drops, so that the quality of drops is the same
regardless of whether you're in Normal, TVHM, or any Mayhem mode.

I personally recommend the use of Expanded Legendary Pools with this mod, so that
the loot you come across is as varied as possible.

For a list of what drops you should expect from bosses, while using this mod, see
