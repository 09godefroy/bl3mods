### Adjusts the character-specific weighting so that character-specific
### gear (such as COMs, customizations, and anointments) should drop at
### about equal rates, instead of being weighted towards the currently-
### active characters.  This is basically the opposite of my No Wasted
### Equipment mod.
###
### This is really only intended for my own mod-testing purposes, and
### might have some unintended consequences when used in ordinary
### gameplay, so beware!  COMs, customizations, and character-specific
### anointments are likely to start overpowering all other loot.

# This could be done more gracefully, but I'm just setting the "base"
# character-specific weight to 200.  Each character class in-game
# adds 0.85 to this value, which is negligible compared to the 200.
