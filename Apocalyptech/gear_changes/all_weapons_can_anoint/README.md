All Weapons Can Anoint
======================

There are a number of weapons in the game which can't usually spawn with
anointments.  This mod makes it so that they can.

This *does* exclude The Shoddy, since it seems quite fitting that that
gun wouldn't have anointments on it.

Should be up to date with DLC5 (Designer's Cut).
