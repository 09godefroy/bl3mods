# BL3 Randomizer
Here you can find the Gear Randomizer files for the Randomizer "mod-pack".

If you are looking for the Enemy and Skill Randomizer mods then those are being hosted in (a) separate Github repo(s) due to their need to be re-generated to provide different results. If using the one from SSpyR note that the full GUI window will take a bit to load up, this is normal.

(Now there are two!)

(Now the exe for the python version can be found in this repo! See randomizer.exe!)

(Note: If you wish to generate a skill randomizer without 4th Skill Tree, currently only HackerSmacker's program will suffice)
