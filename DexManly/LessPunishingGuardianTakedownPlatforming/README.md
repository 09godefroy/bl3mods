Less Punishing Guardian Takedown Platforming
============================================

Map modifications intended to make platforming less punishing. The intent
was to keep the core gameplay as much as possible, yet take out some of the
sting you feel if you miss your jump, or get meleed off a charge platform.

Added:
* An invisible platform under the first digistruct jump puzzle before 3x crystal charge.
* Extra platform trim around the left and right charge islands.
* A mini wall around the center charge island. Before that you could fall off easy.
* Two bridges to replace the digistruct jumping puzzle after the 3x crystal charge stage.
* A floor to the center hole of the platform you usually would digistruct jump to & from.

Changelog
=========

**v1.0.0** - Jan 25, 2021
