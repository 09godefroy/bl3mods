Apocalyptech's Mod-Testing BL3 Mods
===================================

These are a collection of mods that I basically just only use when I'm looking
to test out other mods.  They're focused on making ridiculous OP buffs to gear
so I don't have to worry about combat, and quickly levelling up characters, etc.

See the individual mod folders for full READMEs.

- **Arms Race Cheat** - A mod to make Arms Race completely trivial.
- **Fast Levelling** - A collection of mods to provide increased XP acquisition.
- **Modtest Char Setup** - A mod to build up a mod-testing character at the
  beginning of the game, without needing save editing.
- **Super Buff: Crader's EM-P5** - Absurdly OP Crader's EM-P5 buffs.
- **Super Buff: Transformer** - Absurdly OP Transformer shield.
- **Testing Loot Drops** - Used to test drops and verify balance names.
