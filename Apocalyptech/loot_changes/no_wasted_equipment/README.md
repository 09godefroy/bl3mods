No Wasted Equipment
===================

This mod makes it so that character-specific attributes will only ever spawn in a version
which is useful to a player currently in the game.  This applies to COMs, Customizations,
and Anointments on gear.

For playing singleplayer, this means that if you're a Siren, you'll only ever see drops
for Siren COMs, Siren Skins/Heads, an Siren-specific anointments (you *will* still see
"generic" anointments, of course, just not gunner/operative/beastmaster ones).

This *should* adjust itself automatically whenever players enter/leave a co-op session,
though that is currently untested by myself.
