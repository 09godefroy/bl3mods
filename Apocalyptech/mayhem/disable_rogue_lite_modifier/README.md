Disable "Rogue Lite" Modifier
=============================

This simply disables the "Rogue Lite" Very Hard Mayhem Modifier, so it'll never
show up in your modifier rolls.  Out of all the modifiers, this is the one that I
will always re-roll to avoid, so I decided to just get rid of it entirely.

Changelog
=========

**v1.0.0** - Sep 26, 2020
 * First versioned release
