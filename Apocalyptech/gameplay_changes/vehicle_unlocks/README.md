Vehicle Unlocks
===============

This unlocks most vehicle parts/skins as soon as the associated
vehicle becomes available, and enemies will have an even chance of
using any given part, compared to others.  Your enemy vehicles will
be quite a bit more colorful!

Note that wheel types are *not* included here, since those are
technically considered different vehicle types by the game, and
are referenced differently in the game objects.

This mod also adds Monster Wheels to a few specific vehicles, so
you'll have an easier source for those:

- Clever Girl (Floodmoor Basin)
- Festive Flesh-Eater (Splinterlands)
- Skagzilla (The Droughts)
- Any Technical in Sandblast Scar

One downside, of course, is that enemy vehicles won't be so strongly
"themed" to their maps, but personally I'd rather see as wide a
variety as possible.
