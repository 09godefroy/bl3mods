Disable Email Loyalty Rewards
=============================

Disables the emailed rewards that you get at 100 kills for a specific
manufacturer.  This does *not* interfere with the "Rewards Card" achievement,
except that you'll no longer get the in-game notifications that you've
reached the goal for the individual manufacturers.

Changelog
=========

**v1.0.0** - Sep 26, 2020
