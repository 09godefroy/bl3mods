Vehicle Unlocks
===============

This mod causes all enemy vehicle spawns to have the widest possible
range of parts available (including skins), right from the beginning
of the game.  Enemy vehicle spawns will also have an equal chance of
spawning each part, so no parts are more rare than others.  This is
intended to make collecting all the vehicle parts easier, and to make
the enemy vehicles quite a bit more colorful!

This does *not* interfere with the Ellie challenges to collect
specific vehicle parts -- even if you already have the parts unlocked,
you can still hijack the specific vehicles and turn them in to
complete the challenge.

Note that wheel types are *not* included here, since those are
technically considered different vehicle types by the game, and
are referenced differently in the game objects.

This mod also adds Monster Wheels to a few specific vehicles, so
you'll have an easier source for those:

* Clever Girl (Floodmoor Basin)
* Festive Flesh-Eater (Splinterlands)
* Skagzilla (The Droughts)
* Any Technical in Sandblast Scar

One downside, of course, is that enemy vehicles won't be so strongly
"themed" to their maps, but personally I'd rather see as wide a
variety as possible.

Despite the word "unlock" in the mod title, note that this does *not*
automatically unlock vehicle parts in your own Catch-A-Ride menus.  You'll
still have to hijack enemy vehicles and scan them in (or use a save editor)
to make the parts available to yourself.
