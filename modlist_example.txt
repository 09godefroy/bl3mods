### Modlist for Borderlands 3 Hotfix Injection
###
### This file is used with the mitmproxy-based hotfix injection system
### available at https://github.com/apocalyptech/bl3hotfixmodding
### At the moment, this is the only publicly-available BL3 hotfix
### modding mechanism, though more are forthcoming.  Other solutions
### are unlikely to use this file format, so if you're not using
### mitmproxy, you can feel free to ignore this entirely.
###
### File syntax:
###
### Any line with a # in front of it is ignored, so you can use those
### to comment the file however you like.  (There is nothing special
### about using three of them; it just makes it more noticeable so I
### use it for section headings.)
###
### Any line that *doesn't* start with a # mark will be loaded in as
### a mod.  If you specify an absolute path (starting with something
### like `C:\` on Windows, or `/` on Linux), that full path will be
### used.  If not, the file will be loaded relative to this file.
### In the examples below, for instance, a bunch of mods from both
### `Apocalyptech` and `SSpyR` are being loaded.
###
### To disable a mod (but keep it in the file in case you want to
### enable it again later), just prefix the filename with a # mark,
### to turn the line into a comment (you'll see plenty of examples
### of that, below, too).
###
### NOTE: This file is just an example!  Feel free to edit this
### however you like; the mods you might want to use are entirely up
### to you!  We've just included a few mods which provide bugfixes
### and Quality-of-Life improvements, and left out the majority of
### mods available in this repo.
