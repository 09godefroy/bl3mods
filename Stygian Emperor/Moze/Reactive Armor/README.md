Moze Skill - Reactive Armor
---------------------------
Created by **Stygian Emperor**

Replaces Moze's tier-4 passive skill, *Why Can't I Carry All These Grenades?*, with a skill that is actually useful to her at high levels: *Reactive Armor*, which increases Moze's and Iron Bear's/Cub's resistance to splash, fire, and radiation damage - including self-damage. I tried to get it to scale better and not have 
the in-game skill card basically *lie to you,* but it was not possible for someone like me who doesn't know what coding even is. 

If anyone knows how to make that happen, please let me know, and I'll give you **50%** of all the **store credit** this mod makes.

Reactive Armor Resistance By Rank
---------------------------------
The in-game skill card tells you the correct numbers for fire and radiation resistance, but incorrectly states that your splash resistance is always double that number. Technically this is only true for Rank 3 of the skill; an unfortunate limitation of my modding capabilities. Refer to the following table for the *actual* numbers for every rank:
|Resistance| Rank 1 | Rank 2 | Rank 3 |*Rank 4*|*Rank 5*|*Rank 6*|*Rank 7*|*Rank 8*|
| :------: | -----: | -----: | -----: | -----: | -----: | -----: | -----: | -----: |
|  Splash  |   27%  |   30%  |   33%  |  *36%* |  *39%* |  *41%* |  *43%* |  *45%* |
|   Fire   |    6%  |   12%  |   17%  |  *21%* |  *25%* |  *29%* |  *32%* |  *35%* |
| Radiation|    6%  |   12%  |   17%  |  *21%* |  *25%* |  *29%* |  *32%* |  *35%* |
*Ranks above 3 can only be legitimately attained through the* ***Grenadier*** *class mod.*
