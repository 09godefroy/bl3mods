The Fakobs Buff
================================

## Description

Buffs the everliving daylights out of the gun "The Shoddy" (AKA The Fakobs)
The gun is obtainable from the sidequest "Money Back Guarantee" in DLC 3
In essense, the gun has become a 1 shot destroyer.
However, it still requires that you be directly on top of your enemy.

## Changes

The item is now classified as a legendary item.
Name change and red text change.
Buffs: Increased damage by 25x

I plan on making more changes, but this is just a start.
