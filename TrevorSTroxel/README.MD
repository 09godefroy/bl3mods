# DESCRIPTION
This will be a program that will attempt to generate hotfix files for people to use in there own games.

# NOTE
I am a college student, so I will not be able to work on this all the time, but I will when I have free time.
This will me a massive passion project for me, so there will be many errors and bugs in my program, so keep in mind.
I will try and take any feedback as soon as I can, but just note that I wont respond to everything. Also no I am not working with
a team, this is something I am doing all on my own


# USEAGE
Currently I do not have a .exe that you can run to start generating files. 
In order to get this working you will need a program that runs python programs.
My personal recomendation is VScode. Later on hopefully you will not need external hardware to generate hotfix files,
but for now you will.

  ## Program Caveat
  I pull from a database I personally use, and because of that I will have to change some parts of the code to hide personal information.
  In the future I wish to move to a public one where anyone can grab this information, but for right now some functionality of the code will not work.
  
  ## Exception
  If you have a SQL server and know how to insert information, then you would be able to use your own tables and database to pull information from.
  I have left in this folder some of the files I used to help format the SQL file I pulled from. You will also want a formatter, which there is one 
  I used in the credits section. If you do not then my program is still useable, just know some functionality will not be useable.

# CREDITS
I did not create most of these files, most of the hard work was already done. 
I decided to make something new from projects other people have done.

  - Specific reposatory I pulled from: https://github.com/BLCM/bl3mods/tree/master/python_mod_helpers
  - SQL File and Object Reference: https://apocalyptech.com/games/bl3-refs/
- Site that help format the SQL file: https://www.jooq.org/translate/
- BL3 Redux Team: They inspired me to try and make this because I saw all the changes they did and what you can do with this game.
  - Link to the hotfix: https://github.com/BLCM/bl3mods/tree/master/EpicNNG
  - Sorry I do not have links to each of the team members, I will add links to each of the team members once I find out each person who worked on it
  - If you did work on it, message me and I will add you to this credits list of people.
