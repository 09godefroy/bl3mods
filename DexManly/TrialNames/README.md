Trial Names
=========================

This mod adds the name of each trial to the proving grounds planets in the Galaxy Menu. I always forgot which
trial related to what map so I think this should help other too. 

I have a couple options to choose from:
* DispayOnly (red)
* SubHeader (purple)
* Full (purple and red)
* ![Promo](https://github.com/DexManly/bl3mods/blob/master/DexManly/TrialNames/exampleImg.jpg?raw=true)

Changelog
=========

**v1.0.0** - May 24, 2021
 * First versioned release
