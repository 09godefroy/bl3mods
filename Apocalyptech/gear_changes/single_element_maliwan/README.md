Single-Element Maliwan
======================

This mod removes the second element that most Maliwan equipment lets you switch
to.  No more constantly-blinking inventory!  You will still technically be able
to hit the "switch mode" button to switch elements, which will bring up an amusing
"gun team plz fix name" note where the element would usually be displayed (which
I think might be technically Fire), but the inventory cards will stay nice and static.

This does *not* affect the D.N.A. or SF Force, since those guns' special abilities
require a second element, and it also leaves the Vault Hero alone, so that gun
now has a legitimate special ability.

Note that if you use my P2P Networker Element Fix mod in conjunction with this one,
the P2P Networker *will* have its second element.

**Note:** This only applies to freshly-spawned guns.  Any Maliwan weapon
already in your inventory (or imported via an previously-existing item code) will
still only have the single element.  It needs to be a fresh spawn, with this
mod active.
