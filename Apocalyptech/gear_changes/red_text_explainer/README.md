Red Text Explainer
==================

This mod puts english descriptions of weapon/grenade special effects right on
the item card, in parentheses, after the red text.  It's a BL3 version of the
Ezeith's BL2 mod.  Shields, Artifacts, and COMs are omitted here because by
large, BL3 already includes descriptions on the card for those (though there
may be some exceptions; I should check).

In cases where there's already an on-card explanation, I've tried to include
"all effects on card" instead of a custom description, but there are a few
cases where that could still be tweaked, so you'll have a double-description.
