Borderlands 3 Mods
==================

This is the github home to a collection of Bordlerlands 3 Mods made using
the hotfix injection method of BL3 modding.  There is currently only one
publicly-available method for doing so, a mitmproxy-based solution:

    https://github.com/apocalyptech/bl3hotfixmodding

Other methods are forthcoming.

For now, the mitmproxy-based `hfinject.py` will expect a `modlist.txt`
file, of the format found at `modlist-example.txt`.  Copy that file
to `modlist.txt` and edit to suit.

Finding Mods
------------

A ModCabinet will exist in the future; for now just browse around here
