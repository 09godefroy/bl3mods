Better Sanctuary 3 Floors
=========================

Sanctuary 3 should be a safe place for users to
drop loot, trade, examine, and sort your loot. 
but too often you end up with loot falling through
the floors. This mod adds square objects under the
floors of Sanctuary 3 so that your loot never is lost!
If you see the giant cheeseburger (mmmm) on the middle
table, then you know you are safte to drop items!
