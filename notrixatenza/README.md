Undo Mayhem Loot Hotfix (April 8, 2021) 
=======================================

This mod reverts the changes regarding the reduced loot drops in Mayhem mode introduced on the 8th of April 2021 hotfix ("Adjusted the world drop rate while players are using Mayhem levels"). 
After applying this mod, the loot drops will be back to pre-hotfix values.

If you want to play coop: Only the host needs to have the mod active for it to work. If the host (with the active mod) joins someone without 
the mod, it won't work (everybody goes back to the nerfed loot drops). So please be aware that the player with this mod active must be the host for everyoneâ€™s drop rates to be affected.
If multiple players have the mod active it will work as well.

If you want to see some test results (pre hotfix (offline mode), post hotfix and with the mod applied) please check the following spreadsheet made by TheGigaMaster:
