Timed Event Enable
==================

This is a collection of mods which can be used to enable any of the timed
events, even when outside their usual activation times.  You can use this to override
a currently-active event, as well.  Note that only *one* timed event is capable of
being fully-active at any time.  You can use my All Event Spawns Active mod so that
all three timed event world spawns occur, but only the active event's missions
and maps will be fully available.

These mods also include the most recent hotfix tweaks that Gearbox was using by the
end of the event.  So for instance the Bloody Harvest mod here includes the audio
fixes that they'd done to Captain Haunt.

My Expanded Event Spawns mod can be used to expand the areas in which event-specific
world spawn changes (haunted enemies, hearts, cartel operatives) can appear.  By
default, each event has a predefined list of areas in which its spawns can occur.
