Black Market World Drops
========================

Sets the Black Market vending machines to use the world-drop Legendary
pools, instead of the three items set by Gearbox.  More or less
intended to be used by my Expanded Legendary Pools mod, to provide the
most variety in the machines.  The machines will contain weapons,
shields, grenade mods, COMs, and relics.
