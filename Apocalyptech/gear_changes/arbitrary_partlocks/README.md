Arbitrary Partlocks
===================

This isn't actually a mod itself.  Rather, it's an interactive script which can
*create* a mod for you, which will allow you to partlock specific balances
however you like.  For instance, if you always want to have a specific scope
on sniper rifles, or a particular barrel on ARs, you'd be able to do so in
here.

The UI is a bit weird, and I'm not going to go into detail here (sorry, perhaps
later when I don't have a million READMEs to write), but hopefully it's
self-explanatory enough.

You *will* need to install the `colorama` Python module in order to run this,
and it requires a working `bl3data` installation with access to extracted BL3
data (see the `python_mod_helpers` directory at the top of this repo).
