Boss Drop Randomizer
====================

Randomizes boss drops (ie: get rid of dedicated loot pools).  Obviously this will
be of no interest to anyone looking to farm specific gear, but for myself, I got
a bit tired of going through the game and ending up using the same gear at the same
points in the game, thanks to boss drops plus Better Loot.  So this shakes that
up a bit.

The drops will retain the *type* of drop, so if a boss was going to drop a specific
legendary shotgun, you will get a legendary shotgun of some sort.

I recommend the use of my Expanded Legendary Pools mod, so that the loot you get
is as varied as possible.  If you're interested in this mod, you might also be
interestd in my Mission Reward Randomizer mod.
