Customizations: Only Heads and Skins
====================================

While testing out various modding activities, I'd ended up completing my collection
of non-head/skin cosmetics at one point, and wanted the game to *only* start dropping
heads and skins.  So that's what this mod does.

I can't imagine it'd be of any use to anyone else, really, but here it is just in case.
