It does not matter if you types any caps in the the entry, the program will make it all lower case. 
This more so for my sanity than anythig else

List of commands (so far):

mod header: creates a header for you hotfix mod

choose file: if you know what information file you are looking for, you are able to choose what the excat file is.
    NOTE: It does not matter where the file is located, the program will be able to find the exact information
    It needs to continue.
    NOTE 2: Later on I will add the ability to choose what you want to do with the chosen file, but for now I only have
    it set up to loop through loot tables, and it will often break. I will be working on it so that it can be more interprative 
    of what you want

find all references: if you enter a valid name the program will return a list off all the times the name has been referenced 
and will wright it into the reslts

make reg hotfix: Will attempt to create a hotfix given the propor inputes:
    NOTE: It requires EXACT information in order for it to work, and even then it 
    still might not fully work because I am trying my best here. Improvements will
    come as I continue to work on this, but just take note that it would be good to
    look at the code that was written and check against other peoples hotfixes to make sure its correct
    as time goes on this should be less and less of an issue, bgut for now its still a concern
