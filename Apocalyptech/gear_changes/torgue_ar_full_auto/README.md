Torgue AR Full-Auto
===================

Makes (nearly) all Torgue ARs full-auto.  The exceptions are just
the handful of legendary ARs which have inherent burst-fire mechanics.
Of the legendary ARs, only the Alchemist and Contained blast actually
merited inclusion in this mod, so it mostly just affects white, green,
blue, and purple Torgue ARs.
