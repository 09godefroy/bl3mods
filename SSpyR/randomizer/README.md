# BL3 Randomizer
Here you can find the Gear Randomizer files for the Randomizer "mod-pack".

If you are looking for the Enemy and Skill Randomizer mods then those are being hosted in (a) separate Github repo(s) due to their need to be re-generated to provide different results

(Now there are two!)

(Note: If you wish to generate a skill randomizer without 4th Skill Tree, currently only HackerSmacker's program will suffice)
