Expanded Event Spawners
=======================

This is a collection of mods (one for Bloody Harvest, one for Broken Hearts,
and one for Revenge of the Cartels) which expands the areas in which their
spawn modifications take place.  For instance, haunted enemies from Bloody
Harvest will never show up in DLC levels or Takedowns, since Bloody Harvest
was released before those (though the 2020 re-launch of Bloody Harvest might
change that).  With this mod enabled, though, haunted enemies could appear
practically anywhere.

Note that this mod, on its own, does *not* enable any of the spawns.  You'd
need to either use my All Event Spawns mod, or one of the Timed Event Enable
mods, in order to actually see the spawns.  This just expands the range that
the spawn modifications can show up in.

Note that these still don't seem to work inside Covenant Pass and The Droughts,
so those are the main known exceptions.  DLC3 areas have been added in to this,
though that's not been well-tested thus far.
