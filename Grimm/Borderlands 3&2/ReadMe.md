Borderlands 3&2
===============

## (IN)COMPATIBILITIES

This mod is not compatible with Early Bloomer, since it already does the same thing. Running it will make anoints drop in your game even if they are removed with this mod.

It is not compatible with any mod that changes the damage of guns and grenades.

It is compatible however with mods that change the global scaling (like BL2 Scaling).

## MOD DESIGN

This is a global balance and QoL mod, that has multiple versions that should please everyone.

## GENERAL CHANGES

This mod completely removes the anointed enemies from the game, except the story ones you encounter that are needed.

The CoV badasses will have Rocket launcher only 10% of the time, they will also use other guns.

The Loot Enemies now appear about 5 times more often than normally.

TVHM is now harder, and the elemental damage against the different types of health bars is changed.

All the gear can spawn at lv 1, furthermore all the slots are unlocked at lv 1.

The two Takedowns are rescaled to be 50% harder than the base game, and the DLC 4 bosses are rescaled to not be bullet sponges.

Weapons now are elemental more often than before, this is even more true for higher rarities (up to very rare, legendaries are untouched)

All the weapons and grenades were rebalanced to be closer to each other.

The grenades augments were reworked so that having two of the same augments doubles the effect, having for doubles that as well (so times 4 the normal effect)

## DIFFERENCE BETWEEN VERSIONS

There are 5 Versions of this mod, that can be rougly regrouped in 3 categories : 

## Vanilla Mayhem : Gives a 2.5 damage multiplier to all guns and grenades (including non uniques)

 This keeps the anoints and the original mayhem scaling.

 The No Modifier version will remove the modifiers.

 ## Mayhem Rescaled : Gives a 2.5 damage multiplier to all guns and grenades (including non uniques)

 This will change the mayhem scaling to accomodate  for the removal of anoints. The modifiers are removed in this version as well.

 All mayhem levels will give the same xp, cash and world drop bonuses.

 The passive skills no longer get mayhem scaling (like fire in the skag den), and melee, action skill damage scaling is nerfed (but there is some still).

 The Less World Drop version will also remove the mayhem world drop bonus. (dedicated drops are unaffected)

 ## No Mayhem : No global damage boost.

 This version is the one you want if you start a new playthrough, since it doens't boost all damage.

 This version is aimed at people who don't want multiple difficulty levels with mayhem, but the BL2 difficulty system with NVHM / TVHM.

 In this version the mayhem levels have no scaling whatsoever, and the gear is the same for all the mayhem levels.

 The mayhem levels are modifiers only, which means you can play with the modifiers if you want without having a difficulty increase, and m11 is used to scale NVHM to your level if you don't want to go through TVHM.

 This is the version i recommend if you want to experience BL3 as if it was closer to BL2 and TPS.
