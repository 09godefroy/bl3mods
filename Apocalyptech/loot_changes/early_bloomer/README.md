Early Bloomer
=============

Unlocks all weapon types, elements, manufacturers, anointments, etc, from the very
beginning of the game, in addition to unlocking all available inventory slots.

The first few chests encountered in Covenant Pass are still locked to providing
pistols-only, but you'll start seeing the full variety of in-game pistols even
from that point.  The mod also removes the level-locking of the Polyaimorous,
Wedding Invitation, and Superstreamer -- to make use of those, you'd likely
need to be using my Expanded Legendary Pools mod.

This mod does *not* unlock the Eridian Resonator or Translator -- I wasn't able
to figure out how to do those via mods.  Those can be unlocked with savegame
editing, though, so I'm unlikely to try for that any longer in here.

Changelog
