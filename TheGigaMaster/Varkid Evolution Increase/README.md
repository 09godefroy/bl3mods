Varkid Evolution Chance Increase
================================

## Description

Tired of varkids never leveling up and evolving? Ever think you should not be able to just run over these creatures? Bored of not worrying about having to take them out quick? If so, this mod is for you!

On normal mode, evolution chance is increased by ~50%, and on TVHM, evolution chance is ~doubled. 

No health adjustments were made, only changes to evolution chances were adjusted.

This may be added in the future, as sometimes they still feel too easy to kill until they evolve.

## Normal Mode

The aim of normal mode was to make badasses more frequent and to rarely fight larva. 
Becuase let's be honest, no one wants to fight larva. Unless you've just stared a new game or are going in undergeared.
These changes are aimed to make varkid's a good source of fun and XP.

Increase larva to adult from 60% to 90%

Increase adult to badass from 30% to 45%

Increase badass to superbadass from 10% to 15%

Increase superbadass to raid from 0% to 5% (currently not in game)

## TVHM

On TVHM, you'd better be ready. Mama isn't holding your hand anymore, the gloves are coming off.
You'd better pray you don't run into a Super Badass level difficulty as soon as you start TVHM and are undergeared.
Kill fast or get killed.

Increase larva to adult from 60% to 100% TVHM

Increase adult to badass from 40% to 80% TVHM

Increase badass to superbadass from 20% to 40% TVHM

Increase superbadass to ultimate badass (AKA Raid) from 10% to 20% TVHM (currently not in game)

## "Raid" Information

One interesting thing to note is that after super badass, the game says "SuperToRaid" for the final evolution stage. In BL2, it was a 3 step process:

super badass -> ultimate badass -> Verminvirous/supreme badass (AKA "Raid")

In BL3, there is no ultimate badass stage.
Digging deeper, it appears that the game decides to go from

super badass -> Verminvirous/supreme badass (AKA "Raid")

They are omitting an evolution stage.
Upon a quick look at the wiki, the spawn chance values for ultimate badass -> Verminvirous/Supreme badass match the vaules for the "SuperToRaid" chance.
This spawn rate is at 0% for normal mode and only a 7.5% chance in TVHM, which matches up with what's in the game data.

So, what does this mean?

The game is skipping an evolution step, and once a varkid reaches superbadass, it has a chance go straight to "Raid". 
However, currently I don't think "Raid" is in the game, so we will have to wait and see what happens.
It'll be fun to go from "Ok this is a good challenge" to "God has abandoned us" by completely spiking in difficulty.


I'm pretty sure once we get the new raid boss, the part of "superbadass -> raid" will become active, but we'll see.

## Future Ideas
Increase all spawns to make super badass 75%+ and "Raid" 50%.

And he is not taking no for an answer.

Normal enemies can jump into pods and evolve. IE a tink can jump into a pod and evolve into a badass tink.
Tink's have turrets, so idk how that would interact. that'd be a lot of work, but a lot of fun.
Certain enemies wouldn't be able to evolve such as goliaths, bosses, mini-bosses, etc.
imagine you're just running and gunning, then a normal enemies just upgrades.

## Final Information

This is the first time I've ever made a mod, let alone do anything involving code (excpet for printing Hello, World! in 9th grade).
So if things don't go quite as expected, don't be shocked when it breaks.

At some point, I may make variations of this mod to allow players to choose how hard will be by increasing/decrasing evolution chances.

This mod was made tons of help and teaching from all the people on the ShowEvil Discord. I would not have of known where to begin without their help and support.
As someone who didn't know how to even open a .JSON file to creating my own mod in a weekend, they were there to help, no matter how dumb the question was.

I plan on updating this periodically, so keep an eye out if a new version releases. 

If you find any issues, please DM me on ShadowEvil Discord @TheGigaMaster. Any feedback/tips/advice/balance suggestions are appreciated. 

Have fun!
