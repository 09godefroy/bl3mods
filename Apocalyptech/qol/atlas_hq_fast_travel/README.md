Atlas HQ Fast Travel
====================

This is a collection of mods which move the fast travel machine in Atlas HQ
to one of a few different locations, to avoid having to take a jog through
otherwise completely-empty areas of the level on your way to take on Power
Troopers or Katagawa Jr.  In all cases, it swaps out another New-U station
in place of the fast travel machine ordinarily in the bank, so your map
state will be remembered properly at the beginning of the level.

There are three variants:

* **Courtyard** - Moves the Fast Travel to the promenade level, just
  outside the entrance to the main Atlas HQ building.  The New-U machine
  which is ordinarily to the right when entering the building has been
  moved over to the bank.  That New-U spawns you pretty far away from the
  machine, when you resurrect -- nearly outside the bank, even.
* **Elevator Base** - Swaps with the New-U station at the base of the
  main Atlas HQ elevator.
* **Rhys' Office** - Swaps with the New-U station in Rhys' Office.
