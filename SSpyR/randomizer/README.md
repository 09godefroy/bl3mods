# BL3 Randomizer
Here you can find the Gear Randomizer files for the Randomizer "mod-pack".

If you are looking for the Enemy and Skill Randomizer mods then those are not stored here directly but rather generated from programs (both initially and whenever a different outcome is wanted). You can find the GitHub Repos to those two programs below. If using the one from SSpyR note that the full GUI window will take a bit to load up, this is normal.

(Now the exe for the python version can be found in this repo! See randomizer.exe! Just download it and run it and it will generate the files in the same folder once the buttons are clicked!)

(Note: If you wish to generate a skill randomizer without 4th Skill Tree, currently only HackerSmacker's program will suffice)
