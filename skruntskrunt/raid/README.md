Name: Raid on Bloodsun Canyon, Raid on VIP Tower, and Raid Bosses
======================

* The Raid on Bloodsun Canyon: Fight all the named enemies in
  Bloosun Canyon who now have the strength of invincible raid boses.
* The Raid on VIP Tower: Fight all the named enemies in VIP tower
  who now have the strength of invincible raid boses. Except
  Freddie. Freddie is level 2 most of the time.

This mod attempts to make bosses tougher and makes boss fights
non-trivial. This mod is meant for Mayhem 10/11 Level 65 End Game
players and meant for COOP play against bosses who are spongier,
stronger, and drop a lot more loot. Bosses tend to drop a lot of their
dedicated loot pool making the long fight worthwhile as you can pick
up the annoint you were looking for.

Balance help is appreciated.
