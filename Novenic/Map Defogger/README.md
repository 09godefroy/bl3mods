Map De-Fogger
===========

Makes it so maps are completely revelaed when visiting a loacation for the first time. No more walking around just to get rid of every bit of fog!

Note: This mod does not reveal crew challenges, fast travel stations, or map transition points.
To have all crew challenges revealed, use Apocalyptech's [Always Visible Challenge Icons](https://github.com/BLCM/bl3mods/tree/master/Apocalyptech/qol/always_visible_challenge_icons)
