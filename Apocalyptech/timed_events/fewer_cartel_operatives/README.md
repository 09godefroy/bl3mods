Fewer Cartel Operatives
=======================

When Revenge of the Cartels is active (or its spawn modifications are active,
such as with my All Event Spawns Active or Timed Event Enable mods), this mod
will reduce the frequency of coming across a Cartel operative out in the world.
I'd ended up finding the default rate to be a little high for my liking, so
this fixes it up a bit.

Changelog
=========

**v1.0.0** - Sep 26, 2020
