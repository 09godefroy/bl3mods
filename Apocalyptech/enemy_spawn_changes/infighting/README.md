Infighting
==========

Assigns basically all enemies to the "enraged Goliath" team, which makes
them as likely to attack each other as they are you.

This is relatively untested, so let me know if it causes anything game-breaking.

I have noticed that some NPCs end up getting classified as enemies because
of this, though they don't actually become hostile.  Some enemies also get
weirdly non-aggressive in general, such as some Belliks in Obsidian Forest.

Amusingly, DLC3 riders can end up attacking their own mounts!
