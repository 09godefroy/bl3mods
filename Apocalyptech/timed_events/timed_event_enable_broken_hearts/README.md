Timed Event Enable: Broken Hearts
=================================

This is a mod which can be used to enable Broken Hearts, after it's been
"officially" closed down by Gearbox.  You can use this to override a
currently-active event, as well.  Note that only *one* timed event is capable of
being fully-active at any time.  You can use my All Event Spawns Active mod so that
all three timed event world spawns occur, but only the active event's missions
and maps will be fully available.

This mod also includes the most recent hotfix tweaks that Gearbox was using by the
end of the event, which is mostly just a few balance tweaks.

My Expanded Event Spawns mod can be used to expand the areas in which event-specific
world spawn changes (haunted enemies, hearts, cartel operatives) can appear.  By
default, each event has a predefined list of areas in which its spawns can occur.
