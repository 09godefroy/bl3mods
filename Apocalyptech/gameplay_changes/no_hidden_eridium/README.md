No Hidden Eridium
=================

DLC6 (Director's Cut) added in the chance for eridium clusters and
eridium jars to spawn in a 'spectral' variety which requires the
player to have a Mysterious Amulet equipped to destroy.  The visual
effect is neat, but this mod makes it so that all eridium cluster/jar
spawns are ordinary, and don't require the Amulet to break.
